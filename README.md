# Hacktoberfest-2018
A repo to get every one up to speed with 2018 Hactoberfest


[Github](https://github.com), [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) and [Twilio](https://twil) this year have brought the hacktoberfest in celebration of open source software. The grand idea here is to get as many developers to contribute to open source software and make it better.

# Here Are the rules of the game

- Make sure you have a github account. If you don't [create one here](https://github.com/join)
- Register for the hactoberfest at [hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)
- Find your favorites repositories on github and open pull requests with your improvements (code, documentation or typographical fixes)
- Check your progress at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/stats/<Your-Github-Username>
  
# How to practice.

- If you are new to github or the concepts of pull requests, you can practice on this repository.
- Open a new pull request changing this file and adding your name to the bottom of the names below.
- I will then merge the requests and you will have one contribution towards your hacktoberfest challenge.
- You can then take this experience to other projects where you have the potential to improve.
